## Introduction

**Metaphors** provide a comparative similarity between two objects by stating one as a function of the other. Often, these exploit hidden similarities between the objects with some exaggeration to emphasize the message being put across. *Metaphors* elicit a certain of amount of joy when used appropriately. This joy stems from our ability to comprehend the message without its' explicit statement. However, for beginners of a language the metaphor is being used in, it can be quite difficult to process these figures of speech. Children and Adoloscents, mostly fall into this category of humans who might find it difficult to process metaphors. Let us a have quick test of how well you can process some common metaphors.

Onto the other candidate in this debate: **Innuendos**. According to Google, it is defined as ," *An innuendo is a hint, insinuation or intimation about a person or thing, especially of a denigrating or a derogatory nature. It can also be a remark or question, typically disparaging, that works obliquely by allusion*."  Most often, these innuendos have some sexual reference to them. They are often easy to spot and often just convey the encapsulated meaning. For example, see the list below and like before see if you can get the actual meaning of these.

## A Deeper Dive into metaphors. 

Building upon this basic understanding of metaphors and innuendos, it is important understand their similarities as wells as differences. A question that will help in this regards, "*Do metaphors posses duality as a inherent trait ?*. In other words, does the usage a metaphor in a sentence give semantic meaning to both the syntactic statement as well as the encapsulated statement. Consider the metaphor, " He cried a river of tears." The syntactic meaning implies there is a river composed of his tears. The intended or encapsulated meaning is that he cried a lot such that his tears could make up the volume of a river. Let us consider another example of a metaphor here.
