# Blogs By Varun Seshadri
Since May 2021, I have been writing blogs at my [website](https://isolatedinfo.space). Currently I am writing two series in the blog:
- **Paper of the Day**: A series that discusses a top paper from [`quant-ph`](https://arxiv.org/quant-ph) every week. The paper is chosen from the top "Scited!" paper on Scirate every Friday. 
- **Information Infidelity**: A series that indulges my shitposting.
